                                Acerose License
                                Version 1 | 2015


                                Preamble

Software distributed under the Acerose License (herein referred to as "the license")
grants those with expressed and valid consent (hereby "the licensee(s)") from the
author(s) (hereby "the licensor") of the respective software unfettered permission to use,
within reason, those portions of the software to which the licensor has granted the
licensee permission. Aforementioned portions will have been agreed upon in a written contract
between both parties.

                                Section 0.
                                Definitions

"fuck"  - Refers to a usually lude and offensive act of a sexual nature between one or more parties,
          where 'parties' hereby can refer to deceased individuals.

                                Section 1.
                                Responsibilities  of the Licensee

The licensee is permitted to create systems dependant upon, or using directly, those portions
of the software accounted for in agreement with the licensor. Should their agreement with the
licensor expire or be revoked with reasonable notice (reasonable referring to a minimum of 12 hours
prior notice of termination of contract), continued usage of the software will be evaluated in
relation to any other applicable licenses. Should it not be possible to continue usage of the
software under an appropriate license as agreed upon by the licensor, usage in all capacities
must be revoked immediately. Further usage will be considered, and pursued at the behest of the
licensor, with no obligation to the licensee.

The licensee will know that any intellectual property licensed to them by the licensor must be
protected. Should the licensee be expected to keep certain property private, and it is found that
due to either negligence, malice, conflict of interest, or any other such reason, that said
property was released to third parties without prior written consent of licensor, reason is posed
for immediate termination of all contracts at the behest of the licensor, with no obligation
to the licensee.

                                Section 2.
                                Responsibilities of the Licensor

The licensor is expected to adhere to the following terms when overseeing licensing of their
works:

    - Unless otherwise stated, any modifications to binding documents which alter the
      terms of the license agreement must be made with a minimum of (12 hours) of prior
      notice to the licensee. The licensor is under absolutely no obligation whatsoever
      to alter any pending changes to these documents at the objection of the licensee.

    - Should the licensee behave in a fashion that is in breach of their contract with the
      licensor, the licensor is expected to inform the licensee that they may go "fuck"
      themselves. Should the licensee neither reach an agreement with the licensor, or
      "fuck off" to the satisfaction of the licensor, there is grounds for an immediate
      and unnoticed termination of contract at the will of the licensor.

    - Should the licensor either dislike a potential licensee, or disagree with the terms
      of a licensee contract during negotiation, renewal, or dispute, the
      licensor is permitted to send any considerable volume of the following to the licensee
      either digitally, or provided that shipment is feasable, physically:

            1.  "Bad Dragon" "CumLube" brand personal lubricant in an amount not exceeding
                100 United States Gallons per-shipping container.

            2.  Assorted photographs of horse penises.

            3.  Any combination of photos documenting sexual acts between a human and
                any species of animal.

            4.  Sincere letters documenting the intent of grave personal harm to the indicated
                parties.

            5.  Material that may be considered by the mother of the licensee to be libelous
                to herself.

            6.  Packages the whereabouts of which may suggest the enclosure of an armed and
                dangerous explosive device.
